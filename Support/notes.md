# Notes

## TODO:

* Debug the following levels for TAS:
	- 900m
	- 1700m
	- 2000m
	- 2500m

* In `kill_player()` (line 1429), the `restart_room()` function is called eight times in the `for dir=0,7 do` loop. This was fixed [in the C# remake](https://github.com/NoelFB/Celeste/blob/master/Source/PICO-8/Classic.cs#L1371).

The 18 strawberries are in the following levels:

* 100m
* 300m
* 400m
* 500m
* 700m
* 900m
* 1200m
* 1300m
* 1400m
* 1500m
* 1700m
* 1900m
* 2300m
* 2500m
* 2600m
* 2800m
* 2900m
* 3000m
